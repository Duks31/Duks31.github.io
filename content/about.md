I am an Undergrad student in department of Mechatronics Engineering at [Nile University of Nigeria](https://www.nileuniversity.edu.ng), I also have interest in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

I interned at Hamoye AI and was exposed to many new technologies like GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, that were used to solve real life problems in the AI field. During the Internship we had Machine Learning/ Data Science projects that required team work and collaboration, this helped me increase my team working skills.

I also use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chidubemndukwe) to practice my machine learning skills. 

I play chess ♟️ :) 

I also have skills in Python, SQL, MachineLearning, MATLAB, Github, Leadership, OpenCV, SQL, Data Analysis.
