      <description>Social media timelines are so captivating because theyâ€™re powered by incredibly sophisticated recommendation systems that seem almost magical in how well they understand user preferences. TikTok is a master of this, delivering a personalized feed that keeps users hooked for hours. The secret behind this is ByteDanceâ€™s cutting-edge recommendation engine, Monolith â€” a scalable, real-time system designed to optimize engagement like never before.&#xA;Recommendation systems can be built using production-scale deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow but they fall short of reaching the main business demands.</description>

      <description>The bitter lesson in ML is that we must make methods that learn how to discover, not contain what we have discovered&#xA;A couple of years ago, the idea of self-driving cars was primarily focused on the use of multiple sensors like LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras. These sensors were mounted on custom-made vehicles or heavily modified production cars to achieve full autonomous functionality. The combination of these sensors enabled the vehicles to detect obstacles, map their surroundings in real time, and make complex driving decisions.</description>

      <description>This is the second part of the GANs episodes, if you missed the first you can check that out here. In the first part, I talked about the why of GANs and a couple of other things, do check it out.&#xA;In this part we will be looking at what it takes to build a very simple GAN architecture. Link to Code here.&#xA;The above code is a very simple implementation of GAN, I will use this to expand on the concept talked about in part 1.</description>

      <description>Understanding GANs&#xA;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the exciting model architectures that gave rise to the increasing popularity of machine learning in the space recently. GANs are generative models, meaning that they create new data that resembles the training data, for example, by creating realistic images of human faces. The images below were created by GANs:&#xA;quite realistic, right? In a GAN, there are two fundamental blocks (neural networks), the generator and the discriminator.</description>

      <description>Generative AI at the moment&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Generative AI, particularly propagated by large language models (LLMs), is a rapidly advancing field with numerous exciting developments. LLMs, like GPT-4, exhibit remarkable proficiency in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. Capable of producing grammatically correct and semantically meaningful content, these models have found applications in diverse domains, such as generating articles, stories, chatbot responses, and even entire books. The key strength of LLMs lies in their capacity to learn complex language patterns from vast datasets, enabling them to generate text with a level of complexity and nuance that manual programming would struggle to achieve.</description>

      <description>Introduction&#xA;Gradient Descent (GD) is a first order optimization algorithms that is used to find the minimum of a given function, it is commonly used in training machine learning and deep learning algorithms.&#xA;In machine learning after you train a model you would like to check how the model performed either by checking the accuracy or any other measure that suites the problem, letâ€™s say you generate a **cost function **which is a measure of how wrong the model is finding a relationship between the input and the output, this is where Gradient Descent comes in, the gradient descent algorithm will optimize the cost function, it will give the minimum value of possible error of your model.</description>

      <description>In our daily lives, we encounter the concept of distance in various forms and contexts. Whether weâ€™re navigating through a busy city, exploring the vastness of the universe, or even contemplating the emotional space between ourselves and others, distance plays a fundamental role in shaping our experiences and understanding of the world. But did you know that distance can be perceived and measured in numerous ways, each offering unique insights into the relationships between objects, ideas, and individuals?</description>

      <description>If you have ever made a classification model, you have probably found out the quality of your model by maybe checking the accuracy. Well that good but check this out.&#xA;Imagine you have a model that predict cats when it is trained on 1000 features containing 990 cats and 10 dogs, if we are to calculate the accuracy it will be 99%. But here the model completely misclassifies all of the apples.</description>
