      <description>Attention is all you need introduced the attention mechanism in 2017 specifically for language translation, Today, every major language model you hear about BERT, GPT, Llama builds on this foundation.&#xA;But what attention? And why did it change how machines understand language?&#xA;The Transformer is a deep learning architecture designed to handle sequential data like text. It processes all words in a sentence in parallel and uses attention mechanisms to learn which words matter more when understanding a given word.</description>

      <description>Social media timelines are so captivating because they’re powered by incredibly sophisticated recommendation systems that seem almost magical in how well they understand user preferences. TikTok is a master of this, delivering a personalized feed that keeps users hooked for hours. The secret behind this is ByteDance’s cutting-edge recommendation engine, Monolith — a scalable, real-time system designed to optimize engagement like never before.&#xA;Recommendation systems can be built using production-scale deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow but they fall short of reaching the main business demands.</description>

      <description>The bitter lesson in ML is that we must make methods that learn how to discover, not contain what we have discovered&#xA;A couple of years ago, the idea of self-driving cars was primarily focused on the use of multiple sensors like LIDAR, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras. These sensors were mounted on custom-made vehicles or heavily modified production cars to achieve full autonomous functionality. The combination of these sensors enabled the vehicles to detect obstacles, map their surroundings in real time, and make complex driving decisions.</description>

      <description>Introduction&#xA;Gradient Descent (GD) is a first order optimization algorithms that is used to find the minimum of a given function, it is commonly used in training machine learning and deep learning algorithms.&#xA;In machine learning after you train a model you would like to check how the model performed either by checking the accuracy or any other measure that suites the problem, let’s say you generate a **cost function **which is a measure of how wrong the model is finding a relationship between the input and the output, this is where Gradient Descent comes in, the gradient descent algorithm will optimize the cost function, it will give the minimum value of possible error of your model.</description>
